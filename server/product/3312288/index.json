It’s also absolutely packed with great features and the latest in Bosch dishwasher technology.</p>\r\r\r<p><strong>    ExtraDry       </strong><br>\rFor difficult to dry loads the ExtraDry feature can be activated to get your dishes perfectly dry.</p>\r\r\r<p><strong>     8 automatic programmes      </strong><br>\r\r\rYou’ll always get the best cleaning performance by just selecting the right programme. Water usage, water temperature and rinse time are adjusted exactly to suit the level of soiling. This provides best results while saving water and energy.</p>\r<p><strong>   OpenAssist     </strong><br>\r \rWith OpenAssist you can open this dishwasher by simply touching the front of the unit. This partially opens the door, making it easy to load and unload the dishwasher. It’s handle-free easy-opening. </p>\r <p><strong>   VarioDrawer       </strong><br>\r \rThanks to the retractable VarioDrawer on the the third loading level, there is much more flexibility when loading your dishwasher and more space inside the washing compartment. The cutlery basket in the lower basket can be replaced by the VarioDrawer to create capacity for up to 14 place settings.</p>\r <p><strong>   AquaSensor         </strong><br>\rThe AquaSensor regulates the water usage depending on the type and degree of soiling, using light beams to manage the rinse. Depending on remaining food particles, grease or detergent residues in the rinse, the rinsing process is assessed to evaluate whether it needs to be continued. </p>\r <p><strong>     Heat Exchanger      </strong><br>\r \rDishwashers with heat exchangers treat precious glasses and porcelain with particular care and no risks. Water is pre-heated in the rinsing tank to avoid any temperature shocks.</p>\r<p><strong>  Glass protection technology         </strong><br>\rIn addition to the heat exchanger, glass protection technology offers an extra layer of protection for your glasses. Because soft water causes glass corrosion, glass protection technology constantly regulate the degree of hardness.  </p>\r<p><strong>    Glass 40° programme       </strong><br>\rThe new glass 40° programme gently cleans glasses such as high-quality crystal glasses, while providing optimum drying and achieving a brilliant shine.</p>\r <p><strong>   ActiveWater technology        </strong><br>\rWith this you use less water and less energy, and get more performance.  \rThe water and energy is saved through targeted water distribution, optimised filter technology, and faster heating and higher pump performance for increased water circulation.\r </p>\r <p><strong>     AquaStop       </strong><br>\r \rThe AquaStop system consists of a double-walled supply hose, a safety valve, as well as a floor sump with float switch, offering 100% protection against water damage. </p>\r<p><strong>  Time delay         </strong><br>\rWith the time delay function you can pre-select the programme for the desired start time so your dishes can be ready when you want them.</p>\r\r \r <p><strong>     IntensiveZone      </strong><br>\r \r \r \rWhen you have especially dirty pots and pans the IntensiveZone option can be added to many programmes. This ensures a higher spraying pressure and increases the temperature in the lower basket. Your heavily soiled pots and pans are cleaned optimally whilst more delicate dishes can be placed in the upper basket.</p>\r<p><strong>    LoadSensor        </strong><br>\rThis automatically saves water and energy for fewer dishes.  The load sensor provides for optimal water usage even for half loads or partial loads, saving water and electricity.</p>\r \r \r<p><strong>    TimeLight        </strong><br>\r \rWith this feature the current progress and remaining time of operation is displayed on the floor. </p>\r\r<p><strong>    Resource-saving water management       </strong><br>\rResource-saving water management with intelligent water usage achieves minimal consumption per wash cycle. For example the ActiveWater Eco dishwasher uses only 6.5 litres of water in the standard programme with optimised hygienic cleaning.\r </p>\r\r<p><strong>Quiet Mark</strong><br>\rPlus, with the Quiet Mark stamp of approval, this appliance will work discretely without disrupting the tranquillity of your home.</p>","features":[{"groupName":"","attributes":[{"id":"attr20000353870","name":"Salt Level Indicator","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"YES"},{"id":"attr20000353871","name":"Dimensions","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"H81.5cm x W59.8cm x D55cm"},{"id":"attr20000353872","name":"Type","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"Integrated"},{"id":"attr20000353873","name":"Wash performance","toolTip":"Graded on performance A - G, with A being the highest grade.
