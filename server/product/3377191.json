Zanussi has since played a pioneering role in household appliances. With innovations such as the first gas cooker and the first auto-defrost fridge. Clever Italian design is the cornerstone of their success today, just as it was 100 years ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Everything. Made Easier. </strong><br />\nIn the past 100 years, Zanussi have had a few clever ideas, all based around one thing: to create products that make your life easier. They've lightened laundry loads with XXL capacity washing machines, and in the kitchen they've made ovens that save you elbow grease and clean themselves. They are a home life simplifier, so you have more time for your friends and family.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Design And Innovation</strong><br />\nA perfect marriage between engineering and design ensures that Zanussi develops appliances that are ahead of their time. They strive to simplify your life across a wide range of categories, including refrigerators, cookers, ovens, hoods and hobs, washing machines and dryers.</p>","buyingGuides":[{"title":"Dishwashers Buying Guide","image":"//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/electrical_med_icon?","linkUrl":"https://www.johnlewis.com/buying-guides/dishwashers-buying-guide","linkText":"Dishwashers Buying Guide","longDescription":"Wave farewell to the washing up with your new friend in the kitchen"},{"title":"Delivery Information and Electrolux Group Delivery Exclusions","image":"//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/pdf_ico","linkUrl":"https://www.johnlewis.comhttp://johnlewis.scene7.com/is/content/JohnLewis/electrolux_delivery_111213pdf","linkText":"Delivery information & postcode exclusions for this item","longDescription":"&nbsp;"},{"title":"Built-in Appliances Buying Guide","image":"//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/electrical_med_icon?","linkUrl":"https://www.johnlewis.com/buying-guides/built-in-appliances-buying-guide","linkText":"Built-in Appliances Buying Guide","longDescription":"Built-in (or integrated) washing machines, washer dryers and dishwashers offer a sleek and unobtrusive look"}],"sizeGuides":[],"weLikeItBecause":""},"deliveries":[{"deliveryType":"UK","options":[{"id":"418","price":"0.00","currency":"GBP","shortDescription":"Product delivered by our supplier usually in 5 days, depending on postcode","standardDescription":"Product delivered by our supplier usually in 5 days, depending on postcode","date":"","dateMessage":"","trialMessage":"","isApprovedSupplier":true,"leadTime":1,"cutOffTime":19}]}],"deliverySummary":[{"deliveryType":"TP","title":"UK delivery","price":"0.00","currency":"GBP","summary":"Product delivered by our supplier usually in 5 days, depending on postcode","trialMessage":""}],"emailMeWhenAvailable":true,"skus":[{"id":"237257840","skuTitle":"Zanussi ZDV12004FA Slimline Integrated Dishwasher","shortSkuTitle":"","color":"","size":"","sizeHeadline":"","swatchUrl":"//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/237257840?cropN=0.42105263157894735,0.42105263157894735,0.16842105263157894,0.16842105263157894&","availability":{"stockLevel":32000,"availabilityStatus":"INSTOCK","message":"Available to order","isUnlimitedStock":true},"price":{"was":"","then1":"","then2":"","now":"369.00","uom":"","currency":"GBP"},"code":"88710704","leadTime":"","d2cDeliveryLeadTime":"","media":{"images":{"altText":"Buy Zanussi ZDV12004FA Slimline Integrated Dishwasher Online at johnlewis.com","urls":["//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/237257840?","//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/237257840alt1?","//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/237257840alt10?","//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/237257840alt2?","//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/237257840alt3?"]},"360images":{"swfUrl":"//johnlewis.scene7.com/is/content/JohnLewis/360-degree-view","urls":[]}},"brandName":"Zanussi","unitPriceInfo":{},"priceBand":"","dynamicAttributes":{"modelnamenumber":"ZDV12004FA"},"ticketType":"T"}],"title":"Zanussi ZDV12004FA Slimline Integrated Dishwasher","defaultSku":"237257840","storeOnly":false,"type":"standard","ageRestriction":0,"seoURL":"/zanussi-zdv12004fa-slimline-integrated-dishwasher/p3377191","isFBL":false,"numberOfReviews":1,"price":{"was":"","then1":"","then2":"","now":"369.00","uom":"","currency":"GBP"},"code":"88710704","specialOffers":{"priceMatched":"","offer":"","customPromotionalMessage":"","bundleHeadline":"","customSpecialOffer":{}},"displaySpecialOffer":"","setDetails":{},"templateType":"media-epic-prodtemplate","priceBands":[],"legs":[],"swatchCategoryType":"","deliveryFulfilledBy":"unknown","additionalServices":{"includedServices":["2 year guarantee included"],"optionalServices":[{"id":"233568687","associatedProductId":"1465506","title":"5 years Added Care for your home appliance (includes guarantee period)","description":"All electrical products you buy from us are guaranteed for a minimum of 2 years, at no extra cost.
