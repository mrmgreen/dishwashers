These programmes include a quick wash programme which is ideal for when you need your dishes clean in a hurry.</p>\r<p><strong>Water efficient</strong><br />On a normal 65°C programme, the dishwasher will use just 11.8 litres of water. The AquaSensor measures the amount of soiling at the end of the pre-rinse. If the water is only lightly soiled, it will be re-used for the main wash.</p>\r<p><strong>Quiet</strong><br />At just 50dB, the SMV40C30GB has a low noise level, so once you’ve put your dishes in the wash you can enjoy the rest of your evening in peace. The lack of annoying background noise is especially handy if you’re entertaining guests.</p>\r<p><strong>VarioBaskets</strong><br />With VarioBaskets, you can enjoy a flexible storage space which can be customised to fit your kitchen items inside efficiently. This is handy for washing particularly large items.</p>\r<p><strong>InfoLight</strong><br />The InfoLight feature lets you know when the dishwasher is in use by projecting a dot of light onto the floor. This will prevent you from accidentally opening the door mid-cycle.</p>\r","features":[{"groupName":"","attributes":[{"id":"attr20000353868","name":"Eligible for International Delivery","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"NO"},{"id":"attr20000353870","name":"Salt Level Indicator","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"YES"},{"id":"attr20000353871","name":"Dimensions","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"H81.5 x W59.8 x D55cm"},{"id":"attr20000353872","name":"Type","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"Integrated"},{"id":"attr20000353873","name":"Wash performance","toolTip":"Graded on performance A - G, with A being the highest grade.
