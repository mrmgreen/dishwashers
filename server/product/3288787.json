It’s an A++ energy rated appliance which means it’s kinder to the environment and kinder to your energy bills.</p>\n\n<p><strong>     Vario basket  </strong><br>\nThe Vario basket can be easily placed in the lower basket and provides additional storage space for cutlery. In addition the height adjustable top basket offers extra space, especially for tall dishes.\n<p><strong>  ExtraDry     </strong><br>\nExtra drying option for difficult-to-dry loads.\n<p><strong>    AquaSensor   </strong><br>  \nThe AquaSensor regulates water usage depending on the type and degree of soiling, using light beams to manage the rinse. Depending on remaining food particles, grease or detergent residues in the rinse, the rinsing process is assessed to evaluate whether it needs to be continued.\n\n<p><strong>  Heat Exchanger      </strong><br>\nDishwashers with heat exchangers treat precious glasses and porcelain with particular care and no risks. Water is pre-heated in the rinsing tank to avoid any temperature shocks. You always get the right temperature for optimal dish care.\n <p><strong>   Glass 40° programme    </strong><br>\n This programme gently cleans delicate glasses such as high-quality crystal glasses, while providing optimum drying resulting in a brilliant shine. Additionally, glass protection technology guards against soft water glass corrosion. The dishwasher constantly regulates the degree of hardness. \n \n <p><strong>  Child lock     </strong><br>\nSafety is paramount and the child-proof door lock prevents the door from being opened and the programme being altered during the cycle. \n<p><strong>   ActiveWater     </strong><br>\nThis feature ensures water and energy is saved through targeted water distribution, optimised filter technology, faster heating and higher pump performance for increased water circulation.\n \n <p><strong>   LoadSensor     </strong><br>\n \nAlso saving water and energy use is theLoadSensor. For bigger loads, more water is needed to soak the dishes and the water level decreases. In that case more water is added. For smaller loads, less water is needed for rinsing. \n <p><strong>  EcoSilence Drive     </strong><br>\nEcoSilence Drive works without brushes and is exceptionally quiet, efficient and guarantees low electricity consumption.  \n <p><strong>    Time Delay   </strong><br>\n \nWith the time delay function you can pre-select any programme to start anytime within 24 hours, so your clean dishes are ready when you want. After the start of any programme a display indicates the precise remaining time.","features":[{"groupName":"","attributes":[{"id":"attr20000353870","name":"Salt Level Indicator","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"YES"},{"id":"attr20000353871","name":"Dimensions","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"H84.5cm x W60cm x D60cm"},{"id":"attr20000353872","name":"Type","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"Freestanding"},{"id":"attr20000353873","name":"Wash performance","toolTip":"Graded on performance A - G, with A being the highest grade.
