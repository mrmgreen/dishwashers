This is achieved by maximising water efficiency in the rinse cycles, creating faster heat-up times, targeting water circulation and improving pump performance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EcoSilence</strong><br>\nSimilarly, Bosch's revolutionary brushless motor has been developed to achieve maximum power with minimum energy loss. It's now quieter, faster, more energy efficient, durable and powerful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VarioSpeed</strong><br>\nReduce washing time by up to 50% without compromising on the results with the varioSpeed setting. If you're running short on time, press the varioSpeed button and it will complete a wash and dry cycle in the shortest time possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Flexible loading</strong><br>\nThe SMV46MX00G offers total flexibility with Bosch's varioDarwer system. The retractable third loading level is the ideal place for cutlery and smaller kitchen utensils, creating more space inside the washing compartment. The top basket is also height-adjustable so you can make room for larger, irregular items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AquaSensor</strong><br>\nSaving you even more water and energy, this feature automatically assesses how much water is needed, even during the rinsing stage, and will only use what's necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional features:</strong><br>\n<ul>\n<li>AquaStop lifetime warranty agaisnt water damage</li> \n<li>Glass protection technology</li>\n<li>Electronic delay timer</li>\n<li>InfoLight time remaining indicator</li>\n<li>Load sensor</li>\n<li>Heat exchanger</li></ul></p>\n\n\n\n","features":[{"groupName":"","attributes":[{"id":"attr20000353870","name":"Salt Level Indicator","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"YES"},{"id":"attr20000353871","name":"Dimensions","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"H81.5cm x W59.8cm x D55cm"},{"id":"attr20000353872","name":"Type","toolTip":"","uom":"","value":"Integrated"},{"id":"attr20000353873","name":"Wash performance","toolTip":"Graded on performance A - G, with A being the highest grade.
