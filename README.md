This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Starting from the create react app boiler plate meant less time focusing on setting up webpack etc.

I'm using normalize.css to clear native styles.

## `npm i`

Install the project dependencies.

## `npm run server`

Starts a node server on port 4000. This handles the request for the grid and the individual products.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Runs unit tests.
